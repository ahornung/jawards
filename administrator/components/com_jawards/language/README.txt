There are a few language files for the component jAwards stored here.
If your language is missing, the English file will be used instead.

You can use the English file as basis for your own translation, just
copy english.php in this directory to your language, e.g. italian.php.
Then, just translate the text of each constant, using HTML-encoded
special characters (such as &amp; instead of & and &eacute; instead
of the French Ã©).

If you put your name in the header commment as Author and email the
file to mail@arminhornung.de, it can be included in a future release
of jAwards and more people using your language can benefit from it!
